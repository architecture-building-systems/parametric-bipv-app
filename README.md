ACACIA is a programming interface for a database that can help anyone understand the ponteital impact of a PV module. The content within this repository serves two purposes. The first are example the notebooks that can enable a Python-based way of working with the database and processes. The second is a Flask-based framework for an application interface to the database. This can either be self-hosted or you can go to the following link: https://acacia.arch.ethz.ch.

We provide data for six general types of PV modules:
- Organic
- Monocrystalline
- Polycrystalline
- Perovskite
- CdTe
- CIGS
